It has been a slow year for Rigz but a lot is improving and currently underway.

## REPL Improvements

Until now it has been a slow process to try out the latest version of rigz, unless you're building it for yourself;
the REPL is now updated to always use the latest version of rigz. With the current improvements there is now parity 
between the web and standard versions, where possible. While some portions of rigz won't work in a JavaScript 
environment (i.e. Files), the Process API (spawn, send, receive, @on, etc.) now works in any context. It does behave 
slightly differently in a single threaded context but you will get the same results in both places. Since Rigz doesn't 
have an event loop and isn't using tokio for single threaded environments, it will perform the action when requested or 
when the program ends (if receive is never called directly). I plan on switching to tokio for all use cases but will need 
to rewrite how processes work, currently they're spun up on an IO thread when multi threaded but this has downsides that 
need to be addresses anyway. 

## Web Syntax Highlighting

There is now dedicated syntax highlighting for rigz using highlight.js, no more `ruby` or `rust` syntax highlighting to 
get close enough. It still needs work but at least it will look the way that its meant to and will only get better with 
time. This highlighting is now being used for blogs and the REPL; once I fully iron it out I plan on making a PR to 
highlight.js but for now, if you need highlighting you can use [@rigz-lang/highlight.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rigz-lang/highlight.js).

## New Features

In the <Link to="/blog/$post" params={{post: 'rigz_0.5.0'}} className='text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600'>0.5 blog post</Link> I hinted at a lot of the features planned for 0.6, there have been a lot of 
improvements but still a long ways off on delivering all those goals.

### Completed Features

### rigz_core

There are now dedicated object types in rigz, to support this a minor rewrite was required that introduced the rigz_core package.
If you'd like to extend rigz this should be the only package you need to add functionality, then call `register_object` or `register_module`
in `rigz_runtime`. An example will be created to show how to extend rigz if you're embedding it in your own program. I'm exploring options 
for supporting dynamic libraries that depend on Rust; without embedding rigz in another Rust program there is no way to depend on extra 
Rust dependencies, we'll see where this ends up but I'm optimistic.

### Imports

Imports have been greatly improved, you can now depend on local or remote files. While there will be a package registry eventually the ability to import 
urls will fill that gap for now.

```rigz
import JSON # standard library import

import "utils.rg" # local imports

# url imports, this link doesn't exist
import "https://registry.rigz-lang.org/inapinch/hello_world"
```

### Modules
The HTML, HTTP, and Math modules have been added; the first two also provide objects to better interact with the underlying resources.

### try/catch

While this wasn't mentioned in the last blog post it was a crucial feature that I've wanted in rigz. It's heavily inspired by how zig handles errors;
`try` will either call the value or return an error from that line, `catch` will call a scope when something goes wrong and optionally passes in the 
error that occurred. A warning will be logged when you write `try ... catch ...`, since the catch handles the error. However, long term I'd like to be 
able to handle specific errors and allow chaining catch statements, currently you can't catch an error raised in another catch without wrapping the first 
call in a function.

## In Progress Features

### match & Enums

The first pass at match and Enums have been added, they're nowhere near Rust so it's much closer to a standard switch/case statement but will improve.

```rigz
enum Foo
    Baz,
    Bar
end

foo = Foo.Bar

match foo on
    .Bar -> 42,
    else -> 37
end
```

I don't like adding yet another keyword but using `do` lead to ambiguity, is the do a scope being passed into foo or the match? Rigz should never 
require parenthesis and the few cases that it does will be fixed in future versions or documented carefully.


### Pattern Matching

Getting match working is just one piece of the puzzle, I really want elixir style function pattern matching and have started the process to move 
in this direction. The VM should support it but the runtime does not, and literals will need to be valid in function definitions (not just as defaults).

### Documentation

A lot of rigz is undocumented or poorly documented at best, documentation will be updated when 0.6 releases until then there would be confusion on what's in 0.6 and 0.5. 
As the language gets stable you'll be able to view documentation for past versions, I suspect these will be subdomains for the docs link so that I can keep things accurate between versions.

## Remaining Features

### Formatting

Rigz will provide a standard formatter as part of the language. A basic function has been added but it does not format the code correctly. This will 
be available in the REPL first then added to the 0.6 CLI and LSP.

### LSP

Little progress has been made on the LSP, it includes the format functionality but I need to dig into LSPs more before I can add much here. Additionally
the way I've structured the parser leads to a bad user experience in the LSP, any error would completely stop the processing. I'm comparing options on 
how to best handle this, but the option I'm leaning towards is tree-sitter first then if successful call my parser and runtime to get module/object information. 
While this won't be ideal at least it should apply syntax highlighting and notify all syntax errors before it starts looking for type errors. The main problem is 
that I will need to update the runtime so that it goes through the entire AST and catalogs errors as they come up, I'm still not 100% sure where I want to take this 
though so stay tuned.

### Lifecycles and Meta-Programming

Not much progress here, I'm still torn on how exactly to implement this. I need the ability for custom lifecycles, terraform like @plan & @apply type lifecycles, and some sort of 
macro/code generation functionality. If rigz will always be an interpreted language then Ruby-like metaprogramming is the way to go, otherwise I want something 
that's going to work for the move to LLVM (either C or Rust style macros but zig's style may be the ideal way to handle this).

## Onward

A lot of progress has been made but still a long ways to go, it's starting to feel like a real language though and I'm looking forward to it all coming together.
